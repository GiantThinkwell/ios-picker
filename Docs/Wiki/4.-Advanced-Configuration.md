If you need to enable security or customize store options, please follow the instructions below:

### Enabling Security

- **App Secret Key**

  - Add `#import <FPPicker/FPConfig.h>` into your app's delegate implementation (i.e. `AppDelegate.m`)
  - In you app's delegate implementation, locate `application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:` and add:

    ```objective-c
    [FPConfig sharedInstance].appSecretKey = @"SET_FILEPICKER.IO_APPSECRETKEY_HERE";
    ```

  **NOTE:** This setting is required if security is enabled in [Developer Portal](https://developers.filepicker.io/apps/).

### Customizing Store Options

- Add `#import <FPPicker/FPConfig.h>` into your app's delegate implementation (i.e. `AppDelegate.m`)
- In you app's delegate implementation, locate `application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:` and add:

  1. **Store Access**

    Indicates that the file should be stored in a way that allows public access
    going directly to the underlying file store.

    ```objective-c
    [FPConfig sharedInstance].storeAccess = @"private";
    ```

    - Valid values are `public` or `private`.
    - Defaults to `private`.

  2. **Store Container**

    The bucket or container in the specified file store where the file should end up.

    ```objective-c
    [FPConfig sharedInstance].storeContainer = @"some-alt-container";
    ```

  3. **Store Location**

    Where to store the file.

    ```objective-c
    [FPConfig sharedInstance].storeLocation = @"S3";
    ```

    - Valid values are `S3`, `azure`, `dropbox` and `rackspace`.
    - Defaults to `S3`.

  4. **Store Path**

    The path to store the file at within the specified file store.

    For S3, this is the key where the file will be stored at.

    **NOTE:** For S3, please remember adding a trailing slash to the path (i.e. `my-custom-path/`)

    ```objective-c
    [FPConfig sharedInstance].storePath = @"some-path-within-bucket/";
    ```
